            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>I can't add a friend / City not found:</strong>
                    <p>Ensure you are typing the city name correctly. Our city search relies on a comprehensive database, but try common spellings or major nearby cities if a very small town isn't listed. Both friend's name and city must be filled.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The time for my friend seems incorrect:</strong>
                    <p>Double-check that you selected the correct city and country for your friend, as this determines their timezone. The app automatically accounts for Daylight Saving Time based on the IANA timezone database. Times update every minute; you can also refresh the page/app.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The app is not installing / PWA issues:</strong>
                    <p>Ensure you are using a modern browser that supports Progressive Web Apps (like Chrome, Edge, Safari on iOS). Follow the installation instructions provided on the main page of the app ("How to install this app" button).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Activity icon seems wrong:</strong>
                    <p>Activity icons are based on general assumptions for typical daily schedules (e.g., work hours, meal times). They are an estimate and may not perfectly reflect your friend's actual activity.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Is What's Their Time free to use?</strong>
                    <p>Yes, What's Their Time is completely free to use.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How is my data stored? Where does my information go?</strong>
                    <p>All information you enter (your name, friends' names, and their cities) is stored locally on your device within your web browser's storage (localStorage). This data is not sent to or stored on any external servers. If you clear your browser data or uninstall the app, this information will be lost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How often does the friend's time update?</strong>
                    <p>The time displayed for each friend updates automatically every minute. The list of friends also re-sorts periodically to keep the earliest times at the top.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Can I use this app offline?</strong>
                    <p>Once the app is loaded (and installed as a PWA), it can function offline to display previously added friends' times based on your device's clock. However, searching for new cities to add friends requires an internet connection.</p>
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>How many friends can I add?</strong>
                    <p>There's no hard limit imposed by the app, but performance might degrade slightly with a very large number of friends due to local storage and rendering limitations.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
